# nosql-challenge
 Dear graders,

 Jupyter notebook scripts for this challenge are the NoSQL_analysis and NoSQL_setup files in the root directory. The starter code directory contains unedited starter code. Terminal text markdown includes the console activity when I initialized Mongo and imported the json file. The json file used in this exercise is in the "Resources" directory.
